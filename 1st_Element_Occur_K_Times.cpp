QUESTION : Given an array of N integers. Find the first element that occurs at least K number of times.;
============================================================================================================
Input :
N = 7, K = 2
A[] = {1, 7, 4, 3, 4, 8, 7}
Output :
4
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~
Explanation:
Both 7 and 4 occur 2 times. 
But 4 is first that occurs 2 times
As at index = 4, 4 has occurred 
atleast 2 times whereas at index = 6,
7 has occurred atleast 2 times.;
------------------------------------------------------------------
Approach :::::::::

Use map to store the occurence of each element and return the answer once you find the  element occuring k times;

class Solution{
    public:
    int firstElementKTime(int a[], int n, int k)
    {
        unordered_map<int, int> mp;
        for(int i = 0;i<n;i++){
            mp[a[i]]++;
            if(mp[a[i]] == k)
                return a[i];
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
